# House Price Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning and deploy the model using Streamlit. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and a user-friendly interface for making predictions.

## Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
    cd house-price-prediction
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Explore the dataset and gain insights using the Jupyter notebook provided:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb
```

### 2. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

Run the data preprocessing and feature engineering scripts:

```bash
python src/data_preprocessing.py
python src/feature_engineering.py
```

### 3. Model Training

Train the machine learning model using the provided Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/model_training.ipynb
```

### 4. Streamlit Application

Run the Streamlit application to interact with the model:

```bash
streamlit run app/app.py
```

Visit [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) in your web browser to access the application.

## Additional Information

- Make sure to update the data in the `data/raw_data.csv` file with your dataset.
- Customize the model and its parameters in the `src/model.py` file.
- Adjust the Streamlit interface in the `app/app.py` file based on your preferences.
